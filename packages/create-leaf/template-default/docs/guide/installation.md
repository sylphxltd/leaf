# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0+ or Bun 1.0+
- Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun)

## Create a New Project

The easiest way to get started is using the `create-leaf` scaffolding tool:

\`\`\`bash
# With bun (recommended)
bun create leaf my-docs

# With npm
npm create leaf@latest my-docs

# With pnpm
pnpm create leaf my-docs

# With yarn
yarn create leaf my-docs
\`\`\`

## Project Structure

After creation, your project will have this structure:

\`\`\`
my-docs/
├── docs/           # Your markdown files
│   ├── index.mdx  # Homepage
│   └── guide/     # Guide section
├── leaf.config.ts # Configuration file
├── package.json
└── tailwind.config.js
\`\`\`

## Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
cd my-docs
bun install  # or npm install
\`\`\`

## Start Development Server

\`\`\`bash
bun dev  # or npm run dev
\`\`\`

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
