# Getting Started

Get your documentation site running in under 60 seconds.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
npm install -D @sylphx/leaf-cli

# 2. Create your first doc
mkdir docs
echo '# Hello World\n\nMy first Leaf doc!' > docs/index.md

# 3. Start dev server
npx leaf dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) 🎉

## Installation

Choose your preferred package manager:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @sylphx/leaf-cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun add -D @sylphx/leaf-cli
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @sylphx/leaf-cli
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D @sylphx/leaf-cli
```

:::

**That's it!** The CLI includes everything you need - core framework and default theme.

## Project Structure

A typical Leaf project looks like this:

```
my-docs/
├── docs/                    # Your markdown files
│   ├── index.mdx           # Homepage
│   ├── getting-started.mdx
│   └── guide/
│       └── installation.mdx
├── leaf.config.ts    # Configuration
└── package.json
```

## Configuration (Optional)

Leaf works with **zero configuration**, but you can customize it:

:::code-group

```ts [leaf.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from '@sylphx/leaf';

export default defineConfig({
  title: 'My Documentation',
  description: 'My awesome documentation site',
  theme: {
    nav: [
      { text: 'Guide', link: '/guide' },
      { text: 'API', link: '/api' }
    ]
  }
});
```

```js [leaf.config.js]
export default {
  title: 'My Documentation',
  description: 'My awesome documentation site',
  theme: {
    nav: [
      { text: 'Guide', link: '/guide' }
    ]
  }
};
```

:::

See the [Configuration Guide](/guide/configuration) for all options.

## Writing Content

Create your first documentation page:

```markdown
---
title: My First Page
order: 1
---

# My First Page

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5173 is already in use, specify a different port:

```bash
npx leaf dev --port 3000
```

### Build Errors

Clear cache and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npx leaf build
```

### Module Not Found

Make sure you installed `@sylphx/leaf-cli` (not just `@sylphx/leaf`):

```bash
npm install -D @sylphx/leaf-cli
```
