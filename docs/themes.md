// leaf.config.ts
export default {
  theme: {
    name: '@sylphx/leaf-theme-blog', // Specify theme package
    config: {
      // Theme-specific configuration
      showAuthor: true,
      showReadingTime: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Programmatically

```tsx
import { themeManager } from '@sylphx/leaf/utils/theme-manager'

// Switch theme
themeManager.setCurrentTheme('blog')

// Get current theme
const currentTheme = themeManager.getCurrentTheme()

// List all themes
const themes = themeManager.getAllThemes()
```
